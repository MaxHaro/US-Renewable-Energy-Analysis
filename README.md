# US-Renewable-Energy-Analysis
This project analyzes the rapid evolution of the renewable energy sector in the United States. It features a Python script that automates the entire data pipeline: from programmatically fetching annual generation data via the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) API to processing and structuring the raw data with Pandas. The final output is a compelling time-series visualization created with Matplotlib, which clearly illustrates the significant growth of solar and wind energy compared to more traditional renewable sources.
